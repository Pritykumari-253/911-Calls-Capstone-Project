# Machine Learning Projects
I applied supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning Models on different datasets taken from Kaggle.
Which Includes cleaning, splitting, Training and testing the dataset
Also sometimes we need to standarised and scale few features
After that comes the most important step for evaluating the performance
And plotting the training v/s testing error to observe the accuracy
